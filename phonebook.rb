# phonebook.rb
#
# Goal: Create a phonebook hash with three entries.
#   Use a symbol name for the key
#   Use a string phone number for the value
#
#   Example key: :alice
#   Example value: "123-4567"
#
# - Use `.each` to print one line per entry (with `pp`):
#     "alice: 555-1111"
#     "bob: 555-2222"
#     "carol: 555-3333"
#
# Order does NOT matter.

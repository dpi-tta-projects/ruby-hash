# Goal: Use the hash `stock = { apple: 10, banana: 5 }`.
# - Use `.fetch` to safely read a key provided below and print the result.
# - First: fetch :banana and print the exact output: "banana: 5"
# - Second: fetch :grape with a default message "Not in stock" and print:
#     "grape: Not in stock"
#
# Print both lines, in that exact order, with `pp`.

stock = { apple: 10, banana: 5 }

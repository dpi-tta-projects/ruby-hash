# color_count.rb
#
# Goal: Given an array of colors, count how many times each appears using a hash.
# - Use `Hash.new(0)` for counts.
# - Increment counts via `.each`.
# - Finally, print THREE lines (with `pp`) in ANY order:
#     "red 2"
#     "blue 1"
#     "green 1"
#

colors = ["red", "blue", "red", "green"]

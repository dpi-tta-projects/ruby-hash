# color_count.rb
#
# Goal:
#   Given an array of colors, count how many times each appears using a hash.
#
# Expected Output:
#   "red 2"
#   "blue 1"
#   "green 1"
#

colors = ["red", "blue", "red", "green"]

# Create a 'counts' hash with color keys and count values
counts =  {}

# iterate through colors array to load counts hash
colors.each do |color|
  # if color key exists
    # increment count by 1
  # else
    # set count to 1
end

counts.each do |color, count|
  # pretty print 'color count'
end

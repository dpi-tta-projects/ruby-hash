# contact_card.rb
#
# Goal: Create a hash named `contact` with symbol keys (:name, :email, :role).
# - Set any values you like (strings).
# - Then print (with pretty print) the string:
#     "Name: <name>, Email: <email>, Role: <role>"
#
# Hints:
# - Use symbol keys (e.g., { name: "Ari" }).
# - Build the string using interpolation from the hash.
# - Print the string.
#
# Example output (your values can differ):
# Name: Ari, Email: ari@example.com, Role: Instructor
#
